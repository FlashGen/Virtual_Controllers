Thanks for downloading this code. I hope it will be useful for you. Before 
you open the file please take the time to read this document-  it isn't 
that long but does contain valuable information.

Directory Structure
-------------------
The repository is broken down in to three sections:

src - This contains the source code
bin - A binary SWC file that contains the compiled code in the src folder
docs - Any supporting documents / API information

Files
-------------------
Within the src folder are a set of nested folders (packages) for the 
ActionScript classes used by the controls. There is also a Flash 
Professional file called VirtualControllers.fla in the root of the src 
folder. This FLA will only open in Flash Professional CS5 or newer.

To compile and test the controls, open VirtualControllers.fla in Flash 
Professional and test the movie. This FLA contains a simple example that 
hooks the thumb stick up to a text field to display the output (position) 
of the controller.

Warranty
--------------------
As the Creative Commons license above indicates. This code is provided 'as is' 
and without warranty. Use it at your own risk.

That said, if you do have a question please feel free to drop me an email
